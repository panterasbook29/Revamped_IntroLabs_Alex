This will open the overall scoring screen, as seen below. This screen allows you to see the systems that have the top scores across all areas from beacons to cyber deception.

Please select **10.55.100.111**, then click on Beacon Score on the right.

This will open the beacon score for this system.

Notice the **histogram** on the bottom and the scoring criteria in the middle. 

Notice how on the bottom you can see multiple aspects of this systems connections.  For example, you can see if there are any connections that had a threat intel hit, or if there are any connections that have beacons to a fully qualified domain.

Now, using **AC Hunter**, answer the following questions:

1. In the winlab-agent dataset, what is the connection interval for 10.10.98.30?

2. In the gcat dataset, what is the historic fqdn for the beacon on 10.55.100.111?

3. For the dnscat2-ja3-strobe-agent dataset, what domain has the highest lookup count?
4. Who is doing the lookups?
